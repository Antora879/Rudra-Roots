    <h1>üë®‚Äçüíª My Journey in <span>Web Development</span></h1>
    <p>My journey into <span>web development</span><br> began with a simple curiosity about how websites and apps are<span> created.</span><br>  Over time, this curiosity grew into a deep passion for building user-centered digital experiences.<br> Here‚Äôs how I‚Äôve evolved as a developer:</p>

                <h2>1. The Begi<span>nning</span></h2>
                <h3>I started with the fundamentals: HTML and CSS. At first, I was fascinated by how these simple languages could bring structure and style to the web. I built basic websites and gained a strong foundation in web development that sparked my love for creating digital content.</h3>

                <img src="javascript.jpg" alt="">
            </div>
            <div class="part2">
                <h2>2. Diving <span>Deeper</span></h2>
                <h3>As I became more comfortable with the basics, I realized that the real power of the web lies in interactivity. This led me to JavaScript, where I learned to make websites dynamic and engaging. With JavaScript, I was able to create interactive elements like forms, buttons, and live updates, which made my projects feel more alive and user-friendly. This was a game-changer in my journey.</h3>

            <div class="part1">
                <h2>3. Exploring <span>Frameworks</span></h2>
                <h3>To level up my skills, I dove into modern frameworks like React and Node.js. These tools allowed me to build scalable, efficient, and highly dynamic web applications. With React, I embraced component-based architecture, making development more organized and reusable. Node.js opened up backend development, allowing me to create full-stack applications. The combination of frontend and backend skills enabled me to create complex, real-world projects that were both functional and high-performing.</h3>

            <div class="part2">
                <h2>4. The <span>Design</span> Side</h2>
                <h3>While learning to code, I also developed an interest in UI/UX design. I soon realized that a great user experience is just as important as good functionality. I started exploring design principles and familiarized myself with tools like Figma and Adobe XD. These tools allowed me to design clean and intuitive interfaces that enhanced the overall user experience. By focusing on design alongside development, I was able to create apps that were not only functional but visually appealing and easy to use.</h3>
